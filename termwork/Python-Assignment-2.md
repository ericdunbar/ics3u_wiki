## Learning Goals and Success Criteria

The [Overarching Learning Goals](./images/ICS3U.jpg) for this include _Programming Concepts_.
The specific Learning Goal(s) for this include:
  * We are learning to create simple computer programs (_if you weren't able to demonstrate them in Assignment 1_). &#x1F4D8;
  * We are learning to test, analyze, and document computer programs to ensure accuracy and clarity. &#x1F4D8;&#x1F4D8;


| Learning Goal | Success Criteria  | Learning and Improvement Comments |
| ------------- | ----------------- | --------------------------------- |
| &#x1F4D8;&#x1F4D8; | I can identify and correct syntax, logic, and run-time errors. | |
| &#x1F4D8;&#x1F4D8; | I can validate a program using a full range of test cases (assertions). | |
| &#x1F4D8;&#x1F4D8; | I can use workplace and professional conventions correctly to write programs and internal documentation. | |
| &#x1F4D8;&#x1F4D8; | I can use a tracing technique to understand program flow and to identify and correct logic and errors in computer programs (logging). |
| &#x1F4D8;&#x1F4D8; | I can design algorithms to detect, intercept, and handle exceptions (e.g. division by zero, roots of negatives, etc.) (try/except/raise) | |
| &#x1F4D8;&#x1F4D8; | I can work independently using support documentation to write functioning computer programs. | |
