## Task(s)

This is Part 2 of the [Hardware](./Computer-Hardware.md) project - you are to use the information gathered previously to help you with this project.

### Task 1 (Choose Occupation)
From the list of allowed occupations below, choose an occupation/budget that you plan to go into after high school, or one that is closely related to it.  **Once you advise the teacher of your choice, it is a final decision.**

### Task 2 (Two-Page Report, or equivalent)

#### Page 1 (Computer Build)

You are a new-hire for a company (or are starting your own business) and you need to buy the best computer that you can with the funding provided.  You are required to:
* Purchase individual computer parts (no laptops, or all-in-one purchases), as well as any specific pieces of technology (as noted in the section following the occupation tables) for your occupation.  
  * To help you with this task, there is an [online site](https://ca.pcpartpicker.com/) that can guide you with the main purchases of the computer.  
* Stay **below** the budget given in the occupation you chose.
	* The budget given is in Canadian dollars.
	* Take into account shipping (to the school), 
	* Assume you must pay HST on all purchases,  
	* If you are shipping something from out of country, you will also have to figure out how to deal with customs and tariffs.

For this section, you are going to want to submit the parts, a link to where you bought them, the price point, and why you chose that particular part over others.  When describing why you chose a particular part, you **cannot** just say "It was the cheapest".  There are many "cheap parts", why did you pick this one in particular?

#### Page 2 (Environmental Impacts)
You now have purchased your computer system.  Keeping the context of **your career** in mind, describe:
* The negative effects of creating the computer **hardware**, and
* The negative effects of computer **hardware** after it has been deemed "unusable".
* Possible ways in which **software** can (or could be) used to support environmental protection measures.
  * For example, if you were a biologist, how could software help endangered species in the forests of Africa?
* What possible solutions people in your career would have to reduce the impact of computers on the environment?
* What municipal, provincial, and national government agencies and community partners exist, within your career, that provide resources and guidance for environmental stewardship.


### Task 3 (Submission/Discussion)

* Once you have completed the previous two tasks, organize your findings in whatever medium of your choosing, and submit to the IN drive by the due date of the project.
  * Ensure you meet all of the success criteria below 
* Your teacher will read through the work, and afterwards will have a discussion with you regarding the submission.  
* Be prepared to discuss your work in a present-to-the-teacher format. 
* Be prepared to answer many questions, and ensure understanding of all acronyms you use in your submission.

#### Occupation, Budget, and Other Required Components
Below is a table of particular components that are required for your occupation and must also be purchased along with the computer parts.  Also included in this table is the budget that you must stick to for your particular occupation.

Notes: 
* Any license or operating system purchases **must** be professional versions (e.g. not student versions, pirated, home versions, etc.).
* All computers will need keyboard, mouse, monitor, etc. to make use of the machine.
