# &#x1F4D7; Collaborative Emerging Technologies

## Task(s)

This is a multi-step assignment, take your time to ensure you are completing them properly.  Create a log of what task you completed when for this project.  This will be checked periodically.

### Task 1 (Emerging Technology)
Choose an [emerging technology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_emerging_technologies) (first-come-first-served **teacher-approval required**).  Ensure that you choose something that relates to computer science in some way.

### Task 3 (Collaborative Research Field)
Based on your choice of emerging technology, complete research to determine which fields of study (e.g. bioinformatics, climatology, economics, geology, health informatics, linguistics, sociology, etc.) had to collaborate with computer science in order to develop the product.

For example, if someone were to choose _Speech Recognition_ as their emerging technology, a field of study that could collaborate with them is linguistics.  In linguistics, interpreters could be invaluable for ensuring language translation is recognized in the _Speech Recognition_ emerging technology. (Speech Recognition is not an emerging field anymore, and cannot therefore be chosen as your topic.)

Once you have chosen your collaborative field, you will need to identify a non-traditional career within the collaborative field.  In this context, non-traditional career means: _a career that does not exist yet, or one that will radically change due to the emerging technology_.

### Task 3 (Presentation)
After completing _Task 1_ and _Task 2_ above, you are to create a presentation (in any format of your choosing) that includes **at least** the following:
* Describe your emerging technology choice, in depth.  For example, includes how it works, what it's used for, etc.
* Discuss the impacts (+ and -) of the emerging technology on society.
* Detail 2-4 ethical concerns of the use (or development) of the emerging technology.
* Identify groups and programs that support students who are interested in pursuing the non-traditional career that you chose above (think non-college, non-university programs).
* Describe post-secondary programs that lead to the non-traditional career that you have identified above. 
* Report on trends in the non-traditional career that you identified above, using local, national and international sources.  In this context, trends include how the career has been doing previous (pay, amount of jobs, etc.) and how they are forecast to be in the future.

#### Citations
Cite your work using APA, MLA, or Chicago format (whichever one you want).  
Cite all images used.  You can use just hyperlinks for the citing of **images**.

## Due Dates and Submission Details
You will have a one-on-one interview with the teacher in which you present your information directly to the teacher.
Be prepared to discuss your work and present-to-the-teacher the information that you have found.  Be prepared to answer many questions, and ensure understanding of all acronyms you use in your presentation.

For Mr. Seidel's class, plan for a **maximum** of 15 minutes of presentation time + 5 minutes of question/answer time.  Each presentation is only allotted 20 minutes in total.

Please see the [due dates](./Due-Dates-and-Submission-Details) page for more details on when this is due and how to submit your work.
