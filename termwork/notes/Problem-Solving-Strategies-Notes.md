# Problem Solving Strategies

Although the most intuitive of problem solving strategies that students tend to use frequently is _trial and error_, there are more than just this one style of solving problems.  Below are a list of different strategies we can use to solve problems.

* [Divide and Conquer](#divide-and-conquer)
* [Stepwise Refinement](#stepwise-refinement)
* [Working Backwards](#working-backwards)
* [Extreme Cases](#extreme-cases)
* [Trial and Error](#trial-and-error)
* [Tables and Charts](#tables-and-charts)

#### Divide and Conquer
You have a large problem that you are not sure how to deal with in one shot.  As such, you break your problem into smaller sub-problems.  If these sub-problems are still too large to solve then you continue this process until the solution becomes clear.

#### Stepwise Refinement
This is a variation on _divide and conquer_ in that you break down a large problem into a few general steps to solve the problem.  Once you have a general idea of what to do, you continue to add details to each step until the solution becomes clear.

#### Working Backwards
You have a solution.  Great.  How do we get there?  This problem solving strategy has you start with the solution and then you start undoing the problem one step at a time.

#### Extreme Cases
As you work through a problem, you will want to consider some _extreme cases_ (or extreme values) of the involved variables.  With using the extremes, you will (hopefully) be able to gain some insight into your problem.

#### Trial and Error
For _trial and error_, you make different attempts at solving the problem until you find a solution.  For each of your attempts, you are (hopefully) learning something each time regarding what _to_ do and what _not to_ do.

#### Tables and Charts
This problem solving method requires that you have a set of data that you can graph (or create a chart).  You take the seeming unrelated written data (for example, paired values of time vs money) and create a chart of the data.  The hope is to glean some information from the visual representation of the data to solve a problem.
