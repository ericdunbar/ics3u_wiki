# &#x1F4D9; Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

## Task(s)

You are to go through the SDLC process as if you were creating a particular program as requested by your teacher.

Using your knowledge of the SDLC complete the following tasks.

### 1. Requirement Analysis
Ensure you have a full understanding of what the program requires.  The steps below are highly suggested.
  * This can be completed in multiple ways: survey, questionnaire, questioning the teacher directly, etc.
  * Write down your questions and answers in your log file (see the end of this task for more on logging).

### 2. System Design
Create a quick high-level flowchart as a mock-up to see if you understand what the teacher is looking for.  Approach the teacher with this.  If you need to fix things, go back to (1) above.

### 3. Final Product
After you are sure of what the teacher is looking for, by going through (1) -> (2) multiple times (if necessary) you will want to develop:
  * An in-depth flowchart of the system.  If you are unsure of how much depth you should have in your flowchart, ask your teacher to provide an exemplar or information regarding the complexity of the flowchart.
  * Professional-looking screenshots of what your application would look like.  This includes labeling and naming screens so that someone could easily identify and follow your program.

### 4. Logging
You are going to want to keep a log of what you completed each day of this project.  After completing each phase of the SDLC, show your teacher your progress and your log.

### Extra Information
#### Websites and Applications
There are multiple website applications that can help you with developing screenshots and flowcharts.  Remember that **if you sign up for any online tools** that you are to use your <student#>@pdsb.net account, and do **not** use your real name for anything.  **This is for your personal safety and privacy**.

## Due Dates and Submission Details

Your final flowchart, screenshots, and log are to be handed in by the due date to the IN drive in the appropriate folder.  Ensure that your submission follows the submission guidelines as described below.

Please see the [due dates and submission details](./Due-Dates-and-Submission-Details) page for more details on when this is due and how to submit your work.

## Learning Goals and Success Criteria

The [Overarching Learning Goal(s)](./images/ICS3U.jpg) for this include _Projects and Algorithms_.
The specific Learning Goal(s) for this include:
  * We are learning to effectively use the software development life cycle to plan and design computer programs. &#x1F4D9;
