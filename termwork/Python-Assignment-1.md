| Learning Goal | Success Criteria  | Learning and Improvement Comments |
| ------------- | ----------------- | --------------------------------- |
| &#x1F4D8; | I can use constants and variables correctly in my program. | |
| &#x1F4D8; | I can use selection control structures (if statements) appropriately in a program. | |
| &#x1F4D8; | I can use repetition control structures (loops) appropriately in a program. | |
| &#x1F4D8; | I can write algorithms that use nested structures. | |
| &#x1F4D8; | I can write programs that declare, initialize, modify, and access one-dimensional arrays (lists). | |
| &#x1F4D8; | I can write custom subprograms that use parameter passing and appropriate scope to perform specific tasks in a program (functions with parameters). | |
