# Exercise Set (B)

For all of these exercises, do **not** hand them in, just ensure your teacher sees the work, and that you can communicate your understanding of the work related to the learning goals.

It is highly suggested that you complete these 3 exercises **prior** to attempting [Processing - Assignment 2](Processing-Assignment-2)

## Exercise 6
_Estimated time to complete: 2-4 classes_

1. Recreate the image below. You will need to use the ```%``` operator and ```while``` loops to complete this task.

## Exercise 7
_Estimated time to complete: 1-3 classes_

1. Recreate the image below. Use ```for``` loops to complete this task.  You can technically complete this task using ```while``` loops, but it is expected that you practice using ```for``` loops.
