# Exercise Set (A)

For all of these exercises, do **not** hand them in, just ensure your teacher sees the work, and that you can communicate your understanding of the work related to the learning goals.

It is highly suggested that you complete these 5 exercises **prior** to attempting [Processing - Assignment 1](Processing-Assignment-1)

## Exercise 1
_Estimated time to complete: 2-3 classes_

1. Using your knowledge of Processing so far, recreate the image below. Use color, strokeWeight, strokeJoin, fill, etc. to enhance the picture

## Exercise 2
_Estimated time to complete: 2 classes_

1. Using your knowledge of Processing so far, recreate the image below. Use a screen size of at least 640 pixels wide, and you should be using **only** the arc() function
