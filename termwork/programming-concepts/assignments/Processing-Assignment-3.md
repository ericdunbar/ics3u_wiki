## Task(s)
Either on your own, or in pairs, create an original program based on the requirements set out by one of the clients below.

1. Using your knowledge of programming, if statements, functions, loops, arrays, and (either) Strings or PVectors _create a program that satisfies the learning goals and success criteria below_, as well as the criteria set forth by the client.  
2. Create a _**design and flowchart**_ for your program **before** starting on the code.  This must be shown to both the teacher and the client prior to coding.

## Task Criteria
1. Choose a client - all clients must be accounted for
2. Depending on the client chosen, there will be different requirements for the software.


### Client Information

Each of the clients below have a different piece of software they would like created for either (a) a teaching tool, or (b) a tool for student-use in their classes.

1. Mr. Miller
2. Ms. McInnis
3. Ms. Darroch
4. Ms. McEwen
