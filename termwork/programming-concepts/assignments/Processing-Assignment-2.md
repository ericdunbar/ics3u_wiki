## Task(s)
You are to complete this task on your own (i.e. no group submissions, or no plagiarizing from each other (or internet), etc.)  

1. Using your knowledge of programming, if statements, functions, and loops _create a program that satisfies the learning goals and success criteria below_.  
2. Create a _**design and flowchart**_ for your program **before** starting on the code.  This must be shown to the teacher prior to coding.


## Task Criteria
Your program **does not** have:
  1. Flashing colours in it
  2. Similarity to exercises, or the given exemplar assignment.

Your program **does** have:
  1. A non-Math-class problem to solve (different than Assignment 1).
  2. A multi-screen program (can click between them, or use the keyboard to swap between them)
  3. Your program fits to a maximum ```size(600, 600)```
