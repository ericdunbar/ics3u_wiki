2. Why was this part invented? What need did it fulfill?
3. What other computer part(s) does your part connect to (excluding cables)?
4. What careers were involved in the creation of your particular hardware component(s)?
5. What are the costs for the part (budget version, an average version, and a high end version)
6. What are the pros/cons of purchasing a more expensive version of the part.

##### Mr. Seidel's Group
You will be given a blank Google Slides presentation to work on (this will be shared late April 5th).  Please check your email/shared documents in your @pdsb.net account for the file to work on for this.  It is a requirement that you use the Google Slides file that is shared with you as it will be used later on a website to give all of the information to all of you.

Late April 5th, the information on this page will update with an actual listing of group members.
