# &#x1F4D7; Computer Hardware

## Task(s)

### Task 1 (Research and "Present")

* In pre-selected groups of 2-3, you are tasked with creating a slideshow presentation that would be equivalent to a 3-8 minute presentation (to help guide your thinking about quantity of content).  Your presentation will include the topics/information below.
* Groups/part-choice will be given to your by your teacher.  Mr. Seidel's randomized groups/part-choice is below.

#### Computer Parts

1. **Central Processing Unit**: Central Processing Unit (CPU)
2. **Video-Related Information**: Video/Graphics card and GPU
3. **Audio Processing Device**: Audio/Sound card
4. **Other Audio Devices**: Microphones, speakers
5. **Display Devices**: Monitors, projectors, virtual reality displays
6. **Daily Input Devices**: Keyboard, mouse, and touch screens
7. **Specialty Input Devices**: Scanners and drawing tablets
8. **Archival Devices**: Printers (2D & 3D) and tape storage
9. **Storage Devices**: Hard disk drives and solid state drives
10. **Other**: Motherboard, Random Access Memory

#### Presentation Information
You are to complete research on **at least** these questions, but you are expected to come up with your own research elements that you believe would be important:

1. What is this computer part?
2. Why was this part invented? What need did it fulfill?
3. What other computer part(s) does your part connect to (excluding cables)?
4. What careers were involved in the creation of your particular hardware component(s)?
5. What are the costs for the part (budget version, an average version, and a high end version)?
6. What are the pros/cons of purchasing a more expensive version of the part.

##### Mr. Seidel's Group
You will be given a blank Google Slides presentation to work on (this will be shared late April 5th).  Please check your email/shared documents in your @pdsb.net account for the file to work on for this.  It is a requirement that you use the Google Slides file that is shared with you as it will be used later on a website to give all of the information to all of you.

Late April 5th, the information on this page will update with an actual listing of group members.
